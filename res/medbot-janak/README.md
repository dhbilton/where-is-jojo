# MedBot - The Medical Chatbot  
  
## Introduction  
  
MedBot is a capstone project being undertaken by a team of Columbia University students at the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu). The team consists of Andrew Satz, Jonathan Galsurkar, Minghong Zheng, Shengyang Zhang and Janak A Jain.

## About the Project  
  
The project is sponsored by [Synergic Partners](http://www.synergicpartners.com/en/), A Telefonica company and involves creation of a chatbot service that can communicate with a user and provide informed medical advice related to medicinal and drug prescription. The chatbot would encapsulate capabilities involving natural language processing, artifical intellgience and machine learning. We are very happy to share that we are being helped by the wonderful team at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for creating a compelling experience using their [Programmable SMS](https://www.twilio.com/sms) service.
